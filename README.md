# GMTbar
MacOS app to display the GMT time in the top-right menubar
Built because my group for the summer decided to work in GMT (we have collaborators from all over)

XCode is required to build and run the app, but once the app is built and archived (and then deployed locally) the app can then be used direcrly.
